# Project State

## Project Reference

**Product:** Frugal — AI API cost management SaaS
**Core value:** Developers see unified AI spend across all providers and get automated guardrails before costs spiral
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Dashboard Real Data

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 7 (Dashboard Real Data)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase
Status: All plans complete — awaiting verification
Last activity: 2026-06-05 — Completed 03-04: project detail split into server+client, worker.ts bug fixed. Completed 03-02: dashboard/page.tsx rewritten with real data.

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0 (phases 1-2 completed before GSD tracking)
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: N/A

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 1: api_connections.project_id is nullable (project is optional for connections)
- Phase 2: fal.ai key validation is format-only (no cheap validation endpoint)
- Phase 2: provider DB value is 'falai' (not 'fal') — must match UI provider key
- Phase 2: api_key_suffix (last 4 chars) stored plaintext for display; encrypted key never returned

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Decisions (03-03)

- Provider badge column removed from alerts page: alert_log has no direct provider column — omitting avoids multi-hop join for display-only data
- Empty state placed inside Alert History card (stats cards still show 0) — no special header zero-state needed
- Absolute datetime format used for alert timestamps (full history log, not live feed)

### Decisions (03-01)

- Supabase !inner join returns api_connections as array shape in SDK inferred types — use extractProvider() helper to normalize
- getDashboardStats uses in-JS reduce for monthly spend sum (no DB SUM RPC needed)
- getProjectStats fetches connection IDs first, filters usage_records via second query (no project_id on usage_records table)
- Budget limit lookup in getTopProjects uses single .in() query across all project IDs — no N+1

### Blockers/Concerns

- RESEND_API_KEY not yet set — email alerts won't fire until Phase 6
- QStash cron schedule not configured — manual poll only (dev GET endpoint exists)
- Gemini actual usage data requires Cloud Billing API + service account (not via API key) — out of scope V1
- Worker `.eq("is_active", true)` bug — FIXED in 03-04 (b406cec)
